# QuantumFlow: Decentralized Crypto Automation Engine

A powerful platform for building and deploying algorithmic trading strategies and cross-chain portfolio rebalancing solutions, powered by smart contracts and a robust REST API.

This repository contains the source code for QuantumFlow, a decentralized automation platform designed to empower users with the ability to execute sophisticated cryptocurrency trading and portfolio management strategies in a trustless and transparent manner. QuantumFlow leverages the power of smart contracts to ensure secure and automated execution of predefined algorithms, eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries and mitigating counterparty risk. The platform provides a comprehensive REST API, enabling developers to seamlessly integrate QuantumFlow functionalities into their existing trading bots, dashboards, and other applications. Furthermore, QuantumFlow supports cross-chain interoperability, allowing users to manage and rebalance their portfolios across multiple blockchain networks, unlocking new opportunities for diversification and yield optimization. Whether you are a seasoned algorithmic trader or a beginner exploring the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), QuantumFlow offers a versatile and adaptable solution to automate your crypto strategies and optimize your portfolio performance.

QuantumFlow addresses the growing need for accessible and reliable tools in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape. Traditional centralized exchanges often present challenges such as high fees, limited transparency, and potential security vulnerabilities. QuantumFlow provides a decentralized alternative, allowing users to retain full custody of their assets while benefiting from the automation and optimization capabilities of sophisticated algorithms. The platform's smart contract architecture ensures that all transactions are executed according to predefined rules, eliminating the risk of human error or manipulation. The REST API provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the platform, allowing developers to easily build custom applications and integrate QuantumFlow into their existing workflows. By supporting cross-chain functionality, QuantumFlow expands the scope of potential trading and rebalancing opportunities, enabling users to effectively manage their entire crypto portfolio across multiple networks from a single platform.

By combining the power of smart contracts, a flexible REST API, and cross-chain interoperability, QuantumFlow delivers a comprehensive and innovative solution for decentralized crypto automation. The platform empowers users to execute complex trading strategies with confidence, optimize their portfolio performance, and explore new opportunities in the world of DeFi. The open-source nature of the project fosters collaboration and innovation within the community, allowing developers to contribute to the ongoing development and improvement of the platform. QuantumFlow aims to be the leading decentralized automation platform for crypto traders and portfolio managers, providing the tools and infrastructure necessary to navigate the complexities of the digital asset landscape and achieve their financial goals.

## Key Features

*   **Smart Contract Automation:** Core trading logic is implemented in secure, audited smart contracts (Solidity) ensuring trustless and transparent execution.
*   **REST API Integration:** A comprehensive REST API (built with Express.js and TypeScript) allows developers to easily interact with QuantumFlow functionalities from their applications. API documentation is available at `/api/docs`.
*   **Cross-Chain Portfolio Rebalancing:** Supports rebalancing strategies across multiple EVM-compatible chains (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon) using bridge integrations.
*   **Algorithmic Trading Strategies:** Provides a framework for implementing and deploying custom algorithmic trading strategies using JavaScript/TypeScript. Strategies are executed based on on-chain data and off-chain data via API calls.
*   **Risk Management Module:** Integrated risk management module to define stop-loss orders, take-profit targets, and other risk mitigation strategies within smart contracts.
*   **Decentralized Order Book Integration:** Integrates with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap and SushiSwap for order execution, ensuring optimal price discovery and liquidity.
*   **On-Chain Data Analytics:** Leverages on-chain data analytics to provide insights into market trends, portfolio performance, and risk metrics.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** Primary programming language for the frontend and backend development, ensuring type safety and code maintainability.
*   **Solidity:** Smart contract language used for implementing the core trading logic and automation functionalities.
*   **Node.js:** Runtime environment for the backend server (Express.js).
*   **Express.js:** Web application framework for building the REST API.
*   **Ethers.js:** JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
*   **Web3.js:** Alternative JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
*   **React:** JavaScript library for building the user interface (optional).
*   **PostgreSQL:** Relational database for storing user data, transaction history, and other persistent data.
*   **Docker:** Containerization platform for easy deployment and management of the application.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    `git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/QuantumFlow.git`
    `cd QuantumFlow`

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    `npm install`

3.  **Install Hardhat:**
    `npm install --save-dev hardhat`

4.  **Compile Smart Contracts:**
    `npx hardhat compile`

5.  **Deploy Smart Contracts (Local Development):**
    `npx hardhat node` (Start a local Hardhat network)
    `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost` (Deploy contracts to the local network)

6.  **Set up Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the necessary environment variables (see Configuration section below).

7.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    `npm run build` (Build the TypeScript code)
    `npm start` (Start the server)

8.  **Run the Frontend (Optional):** If you are using the optional React frontend, navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

## Configuration

The following environment variables need to be configured in the `.env` file:

*   `PORT`: The port number for the backend server (default: 3000).
*   `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for the PostgreSQL database.
*   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the Ethereum account used to deploy and interact with the smart contracts.
*   `INFURA_API_KEY`: API key for accessing the Infura Ethereum node (required for deploying to public testnets or mainnet).
*   `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: API key for accessing the Etherscan API (optional, but recommended for verifying smart contracts).
*   `CHAIN_ID`: The chain ID of the Ethereum network you are deploying to (e.g., 1 for Ethereum Mainnet, 5 for Goerli Testnet).
*   `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the deployed smart contract.

Example `.env` file:

PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
INFURA_API_KEY=YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
CHAIN_ID=31337
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...

## Usage

The QuantumFlow REST API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for interacting with the platform. The API documentation is available at `/api/docs` after starting the server.

Here are some example API endpoints:

*   `GET /api/portfolio`: Retrieves the user's portfolio information.
*   `POST /api/trade`: Executes a trade order.
*   `POST /api/rebalance`: Triggers a portfolio rebalancing operation.
*   `GET /api/strategy/:strategyId`: Retrieves details of a specific trading strategy.

Example of executing a trade order using `curl`:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "symbol": "ETHUSD", "amount": 1, "side": "buy" }' http://localhost:3000/api/trade

The smart contracts provide the underlying logic for the platform. Developers can interact with the smart contracts directly using Ethers.js or Web3.js. Refer to the smart contract documentation for details on the available functions and events.
